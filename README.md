## Instructions: ##

Using:    resources/UI_Dev_Quiz_wires.pdf - Wireframe instructions    resources/UI_Dev_Quiz.psd - Design layoutplease create the following:  	www/index.html  	www/images/*  	www/js/index.js  	www/css/index.css
The wire describes a simple menu effect that should be implemented via javascript (despite the possibility of creative CSS solutions to accomplish it).

Any of the following js libraries may be used (though are not required):

  - jQuery
  - YUI
  - Prototype.js

Please do not use any other pre-written code (i.e. do not use any jQuery plugins or jQueryUI components).

## Points to consider: ##

  - JavaScript namespacing or otherwise scoping use.
  - code organization, commenting, etc.
  - balancing ease of implementation with anticipating reasonable future requirements
  - CSS rule structure - consistency, top-down structure and balancing semantics with usability.
